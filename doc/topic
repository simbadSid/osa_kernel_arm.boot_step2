Start with the README and the README.TODO.


The README.TODO will tell you what you have to do. 
You will surrender code individually, not in group.

Although you are asked to code alone, 
you may collaborate to learn and progress.

You may leverage the Web as much as you please.

Pay attention to the part of the README that tells you about 
plagiarism and cut&paste. The rules for this project are not 
the usual ones, they are more relaxed versus cut&paste, 
but not regarding plagiarism. You may provide code that is your own

or that is derivative work, in which case you must cite the 
original work. You are asked to surrender code you understand,

that the code is your own or not. The code you surrender must

be fully commented.

You will have three steps to surrender, with added functionality.

    - December 11th.

    - December 18th.

    - January 8th.


Remember that you are asked to read and understand the code base given to you,

not just the code you surrendered for the requested features.
